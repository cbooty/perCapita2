Google Chrome Extension that analyses news stories and provides per-capita analysis of financial data.  It extracts the location and financial data in the news story and displays a table of per-capita values.  This helps give context to huge numbers.  

For example when a news article states a new Toronto Subway line will cost $30 billion, it's difficult to understand how much that is.  By dividing this number by the population (2.9 million), we can see this will cost $10,300 per person, which is more relatable.
